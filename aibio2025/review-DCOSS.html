<h3>DCOSS Review Type 1</h3>
<h4>Double blind policy: Does this paper conform to the double-blind
submission policy? If not, please provide explanations with clear evidence
in the confidential TPC comments section of the review.</h4>
<p>Yes, this paper conforms to the double-blind policy (1)</p>
<h4>Paper length: Does the paper 1) have a length of a maximum of ten (10)
printed pages and 2) follow the formatting guidelines (pages 9 and 10 must
be used only for supplementary material such as theorems, proofs,
implementation details)? If the paper does not comply with these
requirements, it will be rejected</h4>
<p>Yes, this paper conforms to the formatting guidelines (1)</p>
<h4>Paper Summary: Please summarize the paper in your own words.</h4>
<p>This paper proposes approaches for anomaly detection in streams of data.
This can be used in machine learning applications that sometimes try to
adapt to anomalous data, instead of treating it as such. The method is
validated on sleep data from EEG signals and compared with that from the
sleep monitor device's manufacturer.</p>
<h4>Strengths: What are the main reasons to accept the paper? You may
comment on the importance of the problems addressed, the novelty of the
proposed solutions, the technical depth, and potential impact. Your overall
rating should be supported by your review.</h4>
<p>The topic seems timely given the growing application and use of machine
learning approaches for data prediction and inference.</p>
<h4>Weaknesses: What are the main reasons NOT to accept the paper? Again,
think about the importance of the problems addressed, the novelty of the
proposed solutions, the technical depth, and potential impact. Your overall
rating should be supported by your review.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The contribution and novelty could be better clarified, also further
discussing works related to what proposed</li>
<li>The use case about sleep cycle analysis seems a bit abrupt and it is
not well-connected with the previous parts discussed in the paper.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quality of Writing: What is the presentation quality of this paper?
Your overall rating should take this into consideration.</h4>
<p>Some parts could be better connected to improve the narrative.</p>

<p>This paper proposes approaches for anomaly detection in streams of data.
This can be used in machine learning applications that sometimes try to
adapt to anomalous data, instead of treating it as such. The method is
validated on sleep data from EEG signals and compared with that from the
sleep monitor device's manufacturer.</p>
<p>The topic seems timely given the growing application and use of machine
learning approaches for data prediction and inference. However, the
contribution of this work could be better clarified, highlighting its
relevance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the related works should be further discussed to allow
readers to properly appreciate the novelty of the proposed approach.</p>
<p>The part about sleep cycle analysis seems a bit abrupt since most of the
paper discussed anomaly detection. I understand that this is a use case,
but it should be better introduced, also clarifying why this specific one
was chosen. Because of this, the first and second half of the paper do not
seem very well-connected.</p>

<p>likely reject - bottom 50% of all papers assigned to me for review, but

<h4>Paper Summary: Please summarize the paper in your own words.</h4>
<p>Paper puts forward a way to extract anomaly indicators from attention
layers of transformer type deep learning architectures that may help in
anomaly detection.</p>

comment on the importance of the problems addressed, the novelty of the
proposed solutions, the technical depth, and potential impact. Your overall
rating should be supported by your review.</h4>
<p>the paper discusses the pro and cons of reconstruction and prediction
error based approaches in the context of anomaly detection with RNN type
deep learning methods.</p>
<h4>Weaknesses: What are the main reasons NOT to accept the paper? Again,
think about the importance of the problems addressed, the novelty of the
proposed solutions, the technical depth, and potential impact. Your overall
rating should be supported by your review.</h4>
<p>Paper is not relevant to the agenda of Dcoss-IOT. The paper improving
RNN type deep learning models applied to anomaly detection problems. The
proof of concept application is also unrelated to IOT and/or distributed
computing or smart systems.</p>
<p>the paper should be sent to venues such as ICMLA</p>
<h4>Quality of Writing: What is the presentation quality of this paper?
Your overall rating should take this into consideration.</h4>
<p>quality of writing is good.</p>
<h4>Additional Comments: Additional comments (if any) that you would like

<ol>
<li>
<p>transient problems in observation mechanism?-unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in regards to the hypothesis If the learning task to get a detection
threshold that declares anomalies it may not help you to ignore anomalies
especially when it comes to hyper parameter tuning. if it is a
classification task then there is hypothesis will become inappropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in 4.1 with regards to the proof of concept anomaly detection task - i
think measurement noise is normal and inevitable, so why is it being
considered as an anomaly . An anomaly is something that is otherwise not
normal . example presence of a disease either physical or mental, not noise
which inevitable and always there.</p>
