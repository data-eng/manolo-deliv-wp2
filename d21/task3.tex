\mycomment{S}{Task description}{%
The goal of this task is to create a framework that incorporates
techniques aimed to provide distilled high quality data and meta-data
in cases when it is not available for the training phase of AI models
and when, if available, using the original data for training implies
the choice of an architecture that does not suit our objectives on
efficiency. To achieve this, we will develop methods for data
distillation, data compression and hashing, feature extraction and
synthesisation, as well as model inversion for synthesisation of data
from labels. This will be tested on the datasets collected during the
project and thus will be integrated in the framework of the Data
Inspection and Generation component developed in Task 2.1. The
outcomes of this task will be key to feed WP3 with data and meta-data
to support the development of novel algorithms.}
