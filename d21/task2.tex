\mycomment{Task description}{%
This task will implement a range of methods for automatically
annotating data with respect to quality or possible
unreliability. MANOLO will explore anomaly detection and other noise
detection methods that will allow identifying biased, noisy,
inconsistent, or in general low-quality data, as well as data
maliciously manipulated to contaminate the model during training. For
these purposes, data augmentation techniques based on adversarial
machine learning methods (such as controlled noise contamination of
the dataset) will be used. The output of this task will be partially
used in Task 2.3 and will be integrated in Task 2.1.}
